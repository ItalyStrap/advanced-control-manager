Make your web site more powerfull

Bootstrap, Performance and Schema.org

== Description ==

[ItalyStrap](http://www.italystrap.it/) will add powerful features to your WordPress site.
[ItalyStrap](https://github.com/overclokk/italystrap-extended) Also on github.

May the force be with you!

= Features included: =

* **Breadcrumbs** Make your WordPress site SEO friendly with Breadcrumbs and Schema.org and get Google rich snippet in SERP, fully customizable for your purpose (ItalyStrap breadcrumbs class is 10 times faster than Yoast Breadcrumbs).

* **Carousel** Forked from [Agnosia Bootstrap Carousel by AuSoft](https://wordpress.org/plugins/agnosia-bootstrap-carousel/) with my some improvements Add Bootstrap carousel in `[gallery]` shortcode with attribute `type="carousel"` and more functionality, it works only if you have Bootstrap css and js or ItalyStrap template installed. It will not include the files for you, so if they are not present, the carousel will not work.

* **LazyLoad** Lazy load images to improve page load times and server bandwidth. Images are loaded only when visible to the user. This functionality is forked from [lazy-load](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-load/) plugin with my improvements. It work also with my Bootstrap Carousel.

* **Schema.org Local Business** A simple Widget to add [Schema.org Local business](http://schema.org/LocalBusiness) in your widgetized themes (sidebar, footer, ...)
This widget will add microdata information about your  site for SEO purposes.
This widget was present in my [ItalyStrap starter theme](http://www.italystrap.it/) forked from [Roots theme](https://roots.io/) with some improvements of mine, now I've done more improvements thank to [this tool](https://www.searchcommander.com/seo-tools/structured-data-builder/) shared from [Luca Bove](https://plus.google.com/+LucaBove/posts/iM4aTMgzWAu) on googleplus

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I add breadcrumbs in my site? =

Add this code in your template files:

`
<?php if ( class_exists('ItalyStrapBreadcrumbs') ) {
		new ItalyStrapBreadcrumbs();
	} ?>
`

= What if haven't I got Bootstrap CSS? =

If you haven't Bootstrap CSS style for breadcrumbs don't worry about it, you have 2 options, firts option you have to develope your own style for breadcrumbs, second option you can add this css code in your css style theme:

`.breadcrumb{padding:8px 15px;margin-bottom:20px;list-style:none;background-color:#f5f5f5;border-radius:4px}.breadcrumb>li{display:inline-block}.breadcrumb>li+li:before{content:"/\00a0";padding:0 5px;color:#ccc}.breadcrumb>.active{color:#777}`

= How can I use Bootstrap Carousel? =

Add attribute `type="carousel"` at gallery shortcode, this will show Bootstrap Carousel based on the selected images and their titles and descriptions, otherwise it will show standard WordPress Gallery.

= How to activate Lazy Load for images =

For activate Lazy Load there is new page "Option" in ItalyStrap panel, in that page there is a checkbox, check on LazyLoad and let the magic begin :-P

= How do I change the placeholder image in Lazy Load functionality =

`
add_filter( 'ItalyStrapLazyload_placeholder_image', 'my_custom_lazyload_placeholder_image' );
function my_custom_lazyload_placeholder_image( $image ) {
	return 'http://url/to/image';
}
`

= How do I lazy load other images in my theme? =

You can use the italystrap_get_apply_lazyload helper function:

`
if ( function_exists( 'italystrap_get_apply_lazyload' ) )
	$content = italystrap_get_apply_lazyload( $content );
`

Or, you can add an attribute called "data-src" with the source of the image URL and set the actual image URL to a transparent 1x1 pixel.

You can also use italystrap_apply_lazyload helper function for print content:

`
if ( function_exists( 'italystrap_apply_lazyload' ) )
	italystrap_apply_lazyload( $content );
`

Otherwise you can also use output buffering, though this isn't recommended:

`
if ( function_exists( 'italystrap_get_apply_lazyload' ) )
	ob_start( 'italystrap_get_apply_lazyload' );
`

This will lazy load <em>all</em> your images.

= This plugin is using JavaScript. What about visitors without JS? =

No worries. They get the original element in a noscript element. No Lazy Loading for them, though.

= I'm using a CDN. Will this plugin interfere? =

Lazy loading works just fine. The images will still load from your CDN. If you have any problem please open a ticket :-)

= How can I verify that the plugin is working? =

Check your HTML source or see the magic at work in Web Inspector, FireBug or similar.

= I'm using my custom Bootstrap Carousel, why doesn't the second image appear? =

Put the code below in your file js and type your Bootstrap Carousell ID in place of "#YOURCAROUSELID"

`var cHeight = 0;$("#YOURCAROUSELID").on("slide.bs.carousel", function(){var $nextImage = $(".active.item", this).next(".item").find("img");var src = $nextImage.data("src");if (typeof src !== "undefined" && src !== ""){$nextImage.attr("src", src);$nextImage.data("src", "");}});`

= I'm using an external carousel, will Lazy Load work with it? = 

I tried only with ItalyStrap Bootstrap Carousel, please send me any feedback if have any issue with other carousel, however I can't guarantee to solve the issue.

= How can I use Local Business widget =

Simply activate functionality from ItalyStrap option page, add ItalyStrap vCard Local Business in your widgetozed area and then fill in the fields input

For more informations read the documentation

If you have any problem please open a ticket :-)
