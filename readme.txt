[ItalyStrap](http://www.italystrap.it/) will add powerful features to your WordPress site.

= Features included: =

* **Breadcrumbs.** Make your WordPress site SEO friendly with Breadcrumbs and Schema.org and get Google rich snippet in SERP, fully customizable for your purpose (ItalyStrap breadcrumbs class is 10 times faster than Yoast Breadcrumbs).
* **Carousel.** (Forked from Agnosia Bootstrap Carousel by AuSoft with my some improvements) Add Bootstrap carousel in `[gallery]` shortcode with attribute `type="carousel"` and more functionality, it works only if you have Bootstrap css and js or ItalyStrap template installed. It will not include the files for you, so if they are not present, the carousel will not work.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. After activating ItalyStrap, read the documentation for any kind of customization.
6. That's it.  You're ready to go!

Add this code in your template files:

If you haven't Bootstrap CSS style for breadcrumbs don't worry about it, you have 2 options, firts option you have to develope your own style for breadcrumbs, second option you can add this css code in your css style theme:

`.breadcrumb{padding:8px 15px;margin-bottom:20px;list-style:none;background-color:#f5f5f5;border-radius:4px}.breadcrumb>li{display:inline-block}.breadcrumb>li+li:before{content:"/\00a0";padding:0 5px;color:#ccc}.breadcrumb>.active{color:#777}`
