Make your web site more powerful with ACM - Advanced Control Manager

(Requires PHP 5.4 >= and Developers skills)

== Description ==

Always make a backup before install it and always test it in a dev enviroment.

Make shure you have PHP 5.4 >=, better if you have PHP >= 7.0 (PHP 7.x is awesome ;-) ).

If you have any trouble [open a ticket](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/advanced-control-manager).

If you have any feature requests or code issue [open a ticket on github](https://github.com/ItalyStrap/advanced-control-manager/issues).

[ItalyStrap](https://italystrap.com/) will add powerful features to your WordPress site.

[Advanced Control Manager](https://github.com/ItalyStrap/advanced-control-manager) is also on github.

= Purpose =

I developed this plugin with many features because I need them in all sites created for my clients, it also extends the [ItalyStrap Theme Frameworks](https://github.com/overclokk/italystrap) functionality but it works fine with all WordPress themes.

Think about Advanced Control Manager like a Jetpack with many functionality that make your site more powerful and extensible, for example: Lazyload for image with srcset support, widget and shortcode for Twitter Bootstrap Carousel (with lazyload support), widget for displaying lists of posts type with a lot of options like popular posts, last posts, related posts and so on, there are a lot of functionality, see above for the full list of featured.

This plugin is fully developed in OOP. It utilizes [DI Container](https://github.com/rdlowrey/auryn), Dependency Injection, Polymorphism, Inheritance, etc.
If you are a developer you can extend it with his API (Dev docs coming soon).

= Skills required =

Some functionalities need to be personalized with lines of code, for example if you use the new widget for displaying posts you have to add your own CSS style to make it look like your site (you can add it in ACM > settings > Style > Custom CSS or in your theme style.css), I'm working on building some basic code snippets and documentation, but I need a lot of time to do it, please be patient with me :-).

= Advanced Control Manager will always be free =

This is my thanks for what WordPress has given to me.

= Get involved =

If you want to contribute [click here](https://github.com/ItalyStrap/advanced-control-manager) do a fork and do a pull request to the Dev branch :-)

= Want to try the beta functionality? =
To do so you can add `define( 'ITALYSTRAP_BETA', true );` to your `wp-config.php` file, **REMEMBER** that you have to do this in a development enviroment, **do not do this in a production site** and do always a backup.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I add breadcrumbs in my site? =

Add this code in your template files:

`<?php do_action( 'do_breadcrumbs', array() ); ?>`

= What if haven't I got Bootstrap CSS? =

If you haven't Bootstrap CSS style for breadcrumbs don't worry about it, you have 2 options, firts option you have to develope your own style for breadcrumbs, second option you can add this css code in your css style theme:

`.breadcrumb{padding:8px 15px;margin-bottom:20px;list-style:none;background-color:#f5f5f5;border-radius:4px}.breadcrumb>li{display:inline-block}.breadcrumb>li+li:before{content:"/\00a0";padding:0 5px;color:#ccc}.breadcrumb>.active{color:#777}`

= How can I use Bootstrap Carousel? =

Add attribute `type="carousel"` at gallery shortcode, this will show Bootstrap Carousel based on the selected images and their titles and descriptions, otherwise it will show standard WordPress Gallery.

= How to activate Lazy Load for images =

For activate Lazy Load there is new page "Option" in Advanced Control Manager panel, in that page there is a checkbox, check on LazyLoad and let the magic begin :-P

= How do I change the placeholder image in Lazy Load functionality =

`
add_filter( 'italystrap_lazy_load_placeholder_image', 'my_custom_lazyload_placeholder_image' );
function my_custom_lazyload_placeholder_image( $image ) {
	return 'http://url/to/image';
}
`

= How do I lazy load other images in my theme? =

You can use the ItalyStrap\Core\get_apply_lazyload helper function:

`
if ( function_exists( 'ItalyStrap\Core\get_apply_lazyload' ) ) {
	$content = ItalyStrap\Core\get_apply_lazyload( $content );
}
`

Or, you can add an attribute called "data-src" with the source of the image URL and set the actual image URL to a transparent 1x1 pixel.

You can also use ItalyStrap\Core\apply_lazyload helper function for print content:

`
if ( function_exists( 'ItalyStrap\Core\apply_lazyload' ) ) {
  ItalyStrap\Core\apply_lazyload( $content );
}
`

Otherwise you can also use output buffering, though this isn't recommended:

`
if ( function_exists( 'ItalyStrap\Core\get_apply_lazyload' ) ) {
  ob_start( 'ItalyStrap\Core\get_apply_lazyload' );
}
`

This will lazy load <em>all</em> your images.

= Lazy load uses JavaScript. What about visitors without JS active? =

No worries. They get the original element in a noscript element. No Lazy Loading for them, though.

= I'm using a CDN. Will this plugin interfere? =

Lazy loading works just fine. The images will still load from your CDN. If you have any problem please open a ticket :-)

= How can I verify that the plugin is working? =

Check your HTML source or see the magic at work in Web Inspector, FireBug or similar.

= I'm using my custom Bootstrap Carousel, why doesn't the second image appear? =

Put the code below in your file js and type your Bootstrap Carousell ID in place of "#YOURCAROUSELID"

`var cHeight = 0;$("#YOURCAROUSELID").on("slide.bs.carousel", function(){var $nextImage = $(".active.item", this).next(".item").find("img");var src = $nextImage.data("src");if (typeof src !== "undefined" && src !== ""){$nextImage.attr("src", src);$nextImage.data("src", "");}});`

= I'm using an external carousel, will Lazy Load work with it? =

I tried only with the Bootstrap Carousel integrated, please send me any feedback if have any issue with other carousel, however I can't guarantee to solve the issue.

= How can I use Local Business widget =

Simply activate functionality from Advanced Control Manager option page, add ItalyStrap vCard Local Business in your widgetozed area and then fill in the fields input

For more informations read the documentation

If you have any problem please open a ticket :-)
